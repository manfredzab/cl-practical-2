" five years ago , when china 's digital telephone program - controlled switch market was monopolized by various brands of foreign products , we worried about whether china could successfully develop digital program - controlled switches . today , domestically produced high - performance telephone program - controlled telephone switches already account for 36 % of the domestic market share . "
" when china 's national meteorological bureau bought mainframe computers from cray inc . of the u . s . , it just sold us two processors .
today , the maximum computing speed of the ' dawn 1000 ' computer we developed ourselves has already reached 2.5 billion operations per second , exceeding the speed of the computer sold to us by cray inc . "
this is part of the speech delivered at the working meeting of the " 863 program " today by jian song , state council member and concurrently director of the national science commission .
the " 863 program " is china 's high - tech research program , initiated in 1986 .
western developed countries have always restricted the export of important high - tech products , such as high - performance large - scale digital telephone program - controlled switches and supercomputers , to china .
jian song said that " today , china is capable of producing more than 10,000 sets of digital telephone program - controlled switches , and the chief designer of this kind of switch is only 28 years old , graduating from wuhan university . "
most of the research staff who successfully developed the ' dawning 1000 ' computer last year are young people about 30 years old .
today , jian song said to hundreds of high - tech experts representatives and science and technology officials attending the meeting : " the series of achievements we have made in the development and industrialization of high - tech help us to further overcome timid thoughts that high - tech is unattainable . they have greatly enhanced our whole nation 's courage and confidence in realizing socialist modernization .

experts from shanghai 's industries such as finance , commerce , trade and shipping , etc. , believe that , in the next three years , the third industry will make greater contributions to shanghai 's gdp .
brought along by such economic growth points as capital market , insurance , chain commerce , wholesale marketing , container transport , real estate , information services , etc. , the third added value industry is estimated to have an average annual growth of 11 % to 12 % , and the proportion of the third industry in gdp will also increase from 43 % in 1996 to 48 % in 2000 .

at the same time as this , the fast - growing strong " three - capital " enterprises and people - managed and privately managed economies will also maintain rapid growth .
zheng han , director of the shanghai planning committee says that in the next three years the appropriate growth of shanghai 's consumer demand could also support the average annual gdp growth rate to reach 10 % to 11 % .
by experts ' forecast and calculation , in the next three years , the total amount of shanghai 's fixed assets investment is estimated to be 600 to 700 billion yuan , the total amount of consumer retail products is estimated to have an average annual growth rate of 13 % to 14 % , and foreign trade export is estimated to have an average annual growth rate of 10 % to 12 % . all this fits in with the average annual gdp growth rate of 10 % to 11 % .
kuangdi xu , mayor of shanghai , stresses that realizing per capita gdp of 5000 us dollars in shanghai by the end of this century is well - grounded and possible ; but shanghai is also facing the pressure of intensified market competition and the problems of some outstanding contradictions in its economic life .
he says that to meet the challenge and meet the goal , shanghai will promote a new round of industry restructuring , boldly implement state - owned enterprise reforms , and actively exploit new fields for opening up to the outside world to allow shanghai 's economy to again move onto a new stage .

if reform measures are not effective , a crisis of confidence will still exist , and in that case there is the possibility that investors will turn their attention to other , newly rising markets .

the jinchuan nonferrous metal company , which was established in jinchuan , gansu , when the chinese government invested nearly 5 billion yuan , currently has a production capacity to annually produce 40,000 tons of nickel , and the average mining quantity per person per shift has reached an internationally advanced level .
as the largest nickel production base in asia , the largest nickel flash - melting furnace in asia and the 5th of the kind in the world is erected here . it is a symbol of china 's nickel industry technology striding into the world 's advanced ranks .
nickel , called the " vitamin of modern industry " , and with more than 3,000 varieties of alloy , it is the material specially required to develop space - flight , aviation , military and modern science and technology .
in 1958 , china 's geological mineral workers discovered the world 's second largest nickel mine in jinchuan , gansu , with a reserve of 5.53 million tons , accounting for 70 % of china 's domestic proven reserves .
in 1964 , jinchuan company produced the first batch of electrolytic nickel .
from then on , the situation of china 's long time dependence on import for nickel , cobalt and platinum family metals has been changed gradually .
up to now , this place has become china 's largest nickel and cobalt production base and platinum family metals refining center , with an output of nickel and platinum family metals that respectively account for more than 88 % and 90 % of the whole country respectively , being praised as china 's " nickel capitol " .
in 1978 , the jinchuan company was listed by the chinese government as one of the top three bases of integrated utilization of national mineral resources . since then , this enterprise , as a representative of china 's nickel industry , began to step onto its vigorous development road by relying on advances in science and technology .
in the span of 19 years , hundreds of experts and scholars from more than 50 scientific research schools and institutes as well as construction units in china together with the science and technology personnel of jinchuan company , launched large - scale scientific and technological allied offensives focusing firmly on such key problems as mine construction at jinchuan , production maximization , environmental protection , etc .
according to statistics , they have implemented a total of 599 specialty research items , and achieved 186 items of significant scientific research results , among which 139 items won provincial , departmental level and higher level awards and 11 items reached internationally advanced levels .
among these research results , 138 items were applied to production by enterprises to " spin gold from straw " , which greatly raised the production level of china 's nickel industry .
data show that the recoverable valuable elements at jinchuan company have increased from originally 7 kinds to 14 kinds , that the net increase of selective and smelting nickel recovery is 26.5 % and that the rate of smelting recovery of precious metals has increased more than 10 times .
after starting the second phase of the jinchuan project in 1988 , which the chinese government invested a total sum of 2.66 billion yuan in and listed as a national key construction project , the jinchuan company further accelerated its pace of technology advancement .
seeing this as a juncture , it worked hard to improve china 's nickel industry 's level of technology , technique and equipment .
jinyi yang , general manager of jinchuan company said that jinchuan 's second phase project was neither a reproduction or extension of first phase technology or management , nor simply increasing production capacity by expanding production scale . it was an attempt to catch up with and surpass the advanced levels of the world in nickel production technology and techniques , and practice for combining introduced technology and domestic scientific research .
currently , the jinchuan company 's quality products value has reached 89.89 % .
more than 10 varieties of its products , such as electrolytic nickel , sulphuric nickel , platinum and rhodium products , stainless steel products , etc. , have been exported to such countries us , japan , uk , france , iran , united arab emirates , saudi arabia , etc. ( end )

guizhou mao - tai distillery , which is well - known in china and abroad , plans to implement a technology renovation project with an investment surpassing 400 million rmb to further increase the output of mao - tai in the next three years .
in order to solve the enormous need for capital , the company is now striving to issue stock and to attempt more financing channels .
the information was revealed a few days ago by keliang ji , the board chairman of the guizhou mao - tai distillery ( group ) company of china .
keliang ji said this expansion project would increase the annual output capacity of mao - tai by 2,000 tons , reaching an output of 6,000 tons per year by 2000 .
mao - tai , which is praised as china 's " national alcoholic drink " , has a very long history , and is called one of the world 's three famous distilled spirits , the other two being french cognac and the uk 's scotch whiskey .
because the art of manufacturing mao - tai is complicated and its production cycle is long , the output of mao - tai is extremely limited .
the annual output only reached 1,200 tons in 1987 .
in recent years , under the support of the national ministry of finance and the light industry headquarters , the mao - tai distillery invested 530 million yuan rmb to successively implement a two - phase expansion and technology renovation . currently , it has an annual production capacity of 4,000 tons .
in 1997 , this plant made over 4,400 tons of mao - tai ; with sales income exceeding 500 million yuan rmb , and profit and taxes reaching 370 million rmb , both being the best levels in history .
mao - tai , which is made in the chishui river valley area in the northern part of guizhou province in southwest china , is known for its extremely special fermentation technique .
what makes mao - tai even more famous is that first generation leaders of new china had used it to entertain distinguished guests such as former president nixon of the us , tanaka kakuei , former prime minister of japan , etc .

the chinese government recently pointed out that it would take about 3 years to extricate the majority of large and medium - sized state - owned enterprises with a deficit from their current plight through reforming , restructuring , renovating and strengthening management . it would , by the end of this century , endeavor to make the majority of large and medium - sized key state - owned backbone enterprises preliminarily establish modern enterprise systems .
currently , the state council is researching and laying down specific plans and policies for the 3 - year state - owned enterprise reform .
tieying li pointed out that china would actively promote the strategic restructuring of state - owned enterprises using the principle of " grasping the large ones and letting the little ones go " as a major premise . when rebuilding state - owned enterprises into limited companies and stock companies with multiple principle investments and reasonable stock rights structure , and when using capital as the link for structuring parent - subsidiary corporate systems to smooth out reasonable internal group relations , we need to prevent administrative " mandatory matching " and " arbitrarily creating piles " .
the development of a number of large companies and large groups through purchase , merger and alliance that would combine industry , technology and trade and would operate across regions , across industries , across systems of ownership and across countries needs to be encouraged .
according to statistics , at present , china has more than 300,000 state - owned enterprises of which 14,500 are large and medium - sized enterprises .
in the recent period , the momentum of china 's state - owned enterprise reform has obviously increased , and inter - enterprise purchases , mergers and " powerful alliances " have reached a fixed scale .
tieying li said that housing system reform needs to focus on establishing new mechanisms of benefit allotment monetization , and needs to accelerate the process of transforming housing allotments and tangibles to payments .
tieying li said that china had the determination and confidence to reach the target of preliminarily establishing a socialist market economy system by the end of this century .
planned key breakthroughs should be made on some system factors that inhibit establishing new systems so as to accelerate realizing a new phase of resource deployment marketization , benefit allotment monetization , public service socialization , economic operation legalization , and initiating economic system reform .

in recent years , a large number of foreign enterprises of great strength and great developmental vision have entered the new york stock exchange .
according to statistics , currently , foreign enterprises listed on the new york stock exchange have reached more than 340 , tripling the figure 5 years ago .
currently , the number of countries and regions whose enterprises are listed on the new york stock exchange is almost 50 .
last year , there were 61 foreign enterprises recently listed on the new york stock exchange , creating the highest record in the history .
last year , 145 types of stocks were recently listed on the new york stock exchange , of which 42 % were issued by foreign enterprises .
on the basis of analysis , the main reason why so many foreign enterprises are listed on the us securities exchange market is the continuous and steady increase of the us economy , and that the new york stock exchange is a relatively ideal place for raising capital , with its strict management and regulated operation .
statistics show that , capital that foreign enterprises raised on the new york stock exchange has reached 60 billion us dollars since 1992 .
but financial experts from wall street warn that , foreign enterprises entering the new york stock exchange , to a large extent , means that these enterprises need to adopt the strict operations and financial management methods of the us .
if foreign enterprises still lack the conditions to apply these methods , they should not rush blindly to enter the new york market , lest they be left out in the cold .

after the successful implementation of a " soft landing " , the rumbling train of china's economy is running forward smoothly at high speed .
" proper , quick and stable " growth will become the main theme of this year's economic development .
official authorities revealed that this year the chinese government determined that the economic growth rate was 8 % and price levels will be controlled within 3 % .
this means that the whole economic operation situation will maintain a healthy pattern of " high growth and low inflation " .
people in economic circles seem to be more optimistic about the economic outlook .
the growth rate , predicted by concerned experts of the state planning commission , the statistical bureau and the china academy of social sciences , is mostly 1 to 2 percentage points higher than governmental plans .
of course , to a relatively large extent , this depends on aggregate control of using monetary policy as a primary means , or in other words , under the major premises of general tightening , how financial control should timely and reasonably conduct fine tuning .
moreover , the impact of southeast asia's financial crisis should not be underestimated .
on the part of the government , the keynote of a moderately tight macro - economic policy will not be changed .
the key of the current economy is not striving for a higher growth rate , but is adjusting structures and increasing benefits so as to make macro controls which were implemented from the second half year of 1993 obtain greater achievements and push the national economy onto a road of constant , rapid and healthy development .
actually , as main obstacles that restrained economic growth in the past several years -- inflation and the " bottleneck " of basic industries have all been evidently relieved and the macro - economic situation tends to loosen , china's economic development is in a relatively favorable period .
this year , china plans to create an effective pulling force to economic growth through maintaining a moderate and stable growth of investment , consumption and exports .
fixed assets investments will grow by 10 % this year , total volumes of retail sales of social consumer products by 10 % and export growth by 8 % .
after bidding farewell to the age of " the shortage economy " , relations between commodity's supply and demand have changed from a " buyers ' market " to an integrated " sellers ' market " and competition will be intensified .
hence , activating the consumer market , especially the wide rural market , cultivating consumer hotspots and new economic growth points appear to be particularly urgent .
along with comprehensively implementing hardship relief measures taken towards large and medium - sized state owned enterprises , the pace of state owned enterprise reforms will be accelerated greatly , the dynamics of bankruptcies , mergers and assets restructuring will be strengthened , and enterprise deficits are estimated to decrease by 20 % and a number of competitive large and medium - sized state owned enterprises will gradually form .
however , the large amount of worker layoffs that will accompany this will cause unemployment pressure to gradually increase .
china has determined to appropriately place laid - off workers and to strive to control the unemployment rate to within 3.5 % through implementation of a large scale " re - employment " project .
according to estimates , after three years in a row of bumper harvests , if this year's measures are effective , agriculture still has hope of achieving a good harvest .
agriculture's increasing production and peasants ' increasing revenues will create favorable conditions for inhibiting commodity prices and realizing the target of steady economic development .
currently , the degree of dependence on the outside of china's economy has reached 42 % , and the space of utilizing overseas markets and resources is in the process of expanding , but is more easily subject to the influences of the international environment .
under the circumstances of a relative steady domestic demand , the pulling effect of the trend of foreign trade towards economic development is more striking .
taking all factors as a whole , this year's amount of foreign trade will be increased steadily , the import will be increased and the increasing speed of the export will be somewhat slowed down .
people in economic circles said that china should adopt positive and steady measures to solve outstanding problems in economic operations , and special attention should be given to clear up bad assets in time and strengthen financial risk prevention .
forecasting the year of the tiger , although china's economic train will have ups and downs , as long as adjusted and controlled measures are at the right time and appropriate , it is believed that the train will move steadily along the preset track .

information from the ministry of foreign trade and economic said that , after high - speed development in previous years , china 's foreign investment attracting has entered an adjustment period .
statistic figures show that , from january to november in 1997 , the number and contract sum of recently approved foreign investment projects decreased by 15.39 % and 33.52 % respectively over the same period last year , the amount of average foreign investment per project decreased 21.33 % over the same period last year , and the proportion of industrial projects in recently approved projects also decreased by 5.4 % .
since reform and opening up to the outside world , china has been promoting attracting foreign investment even more as an important part of the basic national policy of opening up , the past five years have been five years when foreign merchants ' investments grew fastest , and foreign investments have stepped into the majority of fields of china 's national economy .
the amount of foreign investment actually utilized by china has been increasing in successive years , creating an historical high in 1997 , and a number of projects with particularly intensified technologies and funds have appeared .
on the other hand , since 1994 and 1995 , the number of recently approved foreign investment projects and the contract sum has been continually decreasing , which will directly affect china 's foreign investment attraction growth rate in the period to come .
experts concerned pointed out that , after high - speed development in previous years , decelerating of the rate of china attracting foreign investment was normal .
however , at the beginning of this year , concerned parties announced that , for projects that had foreign invested , and which were in fields encouraged by china such as the new , high technology industry , infrastructure , etc. , the country would implement certain preferential taxation policies .
according to estimates , these policies would attract more foreign companies to invest in china .

china 's import and export trade has been growing for 15 years in a row , and is beginning to become one of the big countries of the world 's trade , in which the flourishing foreign - invested enterprises have been playing an important role .
since the reform and opening up to the outside , china 's foreign trade is developing rapidly , the amount of imports and exports was up from 20.6 billion us dollars in 1978 to 325 billion us dollars in 1997 . since 1983 , import and export trade has been growing constantly and the momentum has not changed as of now .
in the past five years , the proportion accounted for by imports and exports of foreign - invested enterprises in china 's foreign trade has been rapidly increasing , which has promoted the development of china 's import and export trade .
in 1996 , imports and exports of foreign - invested enterprises amounted to 137.1 billion us dollars , 3.13 times that of the 1992 with an average annual growth rate of 33.05 % . the proportion accounting for total national imports and exports is up from 26.43 % in 1992 to 47.3 % .
in the recently past 1997 , in china 's import and export trade , state - owned enterprises and foreign - invested enterprises advanced together , state - owned enterprises continue to take the leading position , whereas foreign - invested enterprises are still playing an important role .
the intervention of foreign - invested enterprises has increased the international competitiveness of chinese import and export products , and also widened trade channels .
increasing the export of mechanical and electrical products is one of the strategic goals of china 's foreign trade , to which foreign - invested enterprises that were established in china have made great contributions .
in 1996 , among products exported by foreign - invested enterprises , industrial finished products accounted for 95.7 % , of which the value of mechanical and electrical products accounted for nearly 56 % of the total value of exported mechanical and electrical products nationwide .
the proportion had another increase in 1997 .

the director of the china national petroleum corporation , binggang zhu , said a few days ago in a seminar held in chongqing , that not only would the china national petroleum corporation like to cooperate with foreign companies in oil exploration and development , it would also like to implement broad international cooperation with foreign companies in downstream product utilization projects for petroleum and natural gas .
binggang zhu said that , in 1993 , the chinese government issued " rules of the people 's republic of china for foreign cooperation in land - based oil exploration " . since then , new sections and chapters on land - based foreign cooperation in petroleum and natural gas have begun , the range of foreign cooperation in petroleum and natural gas was from south to north and expanded rapidly .
more than 10 old oil regions such as the daqing oil field , the shengli oil field and the liaohe oil field , etc. have carved out parts of their areas into zones of foreign cooperation in order to increase recovery ratios .
up to now , three land - based foreign invitationals have been held , and nearly 40 contracts were signed with 40 companies from 14 countries around the world .
among them , natural gas companies in sichuan and chongqi regions have respectively signed with us companies such as texaco , enron , mobil , etc. for risk exploration contracts in the ya ' an and leshan areas ; contracts for improving recovery ratios in the central north of sichuan , and feasibility joint research agreements on natural gas up and downstream integrated projects in the area of wenhuangduo in east sichuan .
binggang zhu said that , cooperating with the outside to explore and develop petroleum and natural gas resources is an important strategic decision for energy , and was a correct choice that was made after fully considering the national situation .
binggang zhu expressed that , china would continue to expand the opening up to the outside and accelerate the pace of cooperation with the outside .
by further increasing cooperation with overseas , and actively introducing foreign capital , technology and management experience , it accelerated the development and utilization of china 's limited oil and natural gas resources in order to make it meet the developing needs of china 's national economy .

in nanchang , another recently built international container terminal was made available for operation recently , thereby further improving conditions of the existing external passageway of jiangxi , an inland province .
near the container dock which was built on ganjiang port , units such as nanchang customs , provincial sanitation inspection , commodity inspection , animal and plant quarantine , etc. established the " freight management area for the nanchang port of the nanchang freight port " .
the local officials said that , the previous situation whereby large numbers of import and export goods of jiangxi province had to be re - shipped through the guangzhou port and the shanghai port in the form of sparse packaging will be changed completely .
during the early days , a 5000 ton class container dock had already been built in jiujiang port in the north of jiangxi . the nanchang port became another " access to the sea " in jiangxi besides the jiujiang port .
according to presentations by responsible officials of this port , the international container terminal of jiujiang port to the north of jiangxi had an area of over 4700 square meters , and 128 standard containers can be hoisted each day , with an annual handling capacity of about 30,000 .
it ended the history of nanchang port not loading or unloading international containers .
persons concerned analyzed that , accelerating the construction of ports handling river cargo was another symbol of the further improvement of location advantages in jiangxi province after the beijing - kowloon railroad opened up to traffic .
the third main artery of china connecting the south and the north , the beijing - kowloon railroad , was completed successfully in 1995 . jiangxi , where one third of the route passes through , has become the province that has benefited the most .
at present , five train lines namely the zhejiang - jiangxi , the yingtan - xiamen , the anhui - jiangxi , the beijing - kowloon and the wuhan - jiujiang , and eleven train lines crisscross across the province . nanchang has emerged from a closed land of the past to become the new inland traffic center .
constructing international container ports has become the inevitable trend of economy development .
the media reported that , in the coastal region , the number of international container docks in the three places namely jiangsu , zhejiang and shanghai alone , had already reached more than twenty .
many inland provinces , including jiangxi , are all further improving investment conditions .
in the next two years , china will improve 2400 kilometers of inland river routes and build more than 160 new berthing points , including container docks .
shengyou shu , the governor of jiangxi province , said , " in the recently ended year of 1997 , the total value of commodity exports was 1.6 billion us dollars , and every effort will be made to breakthrough the figure of 1.8 billion us dollars this year " .

an official from china 's petroleum and natural gas corporation , when being interviewed recently by a reporter from this news agency , said that china will further accelerate prospecting and development natural gas resources of the sichuan basin to increase backup reserves and output , and is preparing to fully utilize natural gas resources , and to develop the natural gas and chemical industry .
currently , the natural gas resources found along the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river are mainly distributed in sichuan province , the chongqing municipality and the northwestern area of hubei province , among which sichuan province and the chongqing municipality 's natural gas resources are the richest . oil exploration area has reached 180,000 square kilometers , with a total resource magnitude of 7 trillion cubic meters .
by the end of 1997 , the totally explored reserves were 510 billion cubic meters , among which the chongqing area had 260 billion cubic meters , and a total of 86 gas fields were achieved .
in recent years , china has been paying close attention to development of the natural gas industry , and has drafted a development strategy for the land - based petroleum industry of " stabilizing the east , developing the west , and increasing oil and gas " .
in the sichuan basin alone , the richest of china 's three great land - based natural gas reserves , an accumulated amount of 163.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas has been produced in the past 40 - odd years . the production has basically satisfied the needs for household fuels of a number of large and middle - sized cities such as chengdu , chongqing , etc. and has resulted in china 's largest vinylon production line with natural gas as its raw material - the sichuan vinylon factory .
natural gas has become the most important raw material resource for energy and chemicals in sichuan province , chongqing municipality and areas of southwest china .
during the " ninth five - year - plan " period ( 1996 - 2000 ) , sichuan basin 's natural gas annual production capacity will reach more than 10 billion cubic meters , among which 5 billion will be from the chongqing region . recently added natural gas of more than 3 billion cubic meters will be mainly in chongqing .
administrator binggang zhu said that china petroleum and natural gas corporation will utilize this recently added capacity to develop natural gas chemical industry in the recently approved municipality of chongqing which has a solid industry foundation .
he said that china petroleum and natural gas corporation will build a new large - scale fertilizer factory in chongqing with an annual production scale of 450,000 tons of synthetic ammonia and 800,000 tons of urea at an annual gas consumption of 500 million cubic meters . the total investment is 3.82 billion yuan , among which 1 billion is self - raised capital . the construction period is 3 to 4 years .
relevant experts believe that this project is very advantageous no matter whether you are talking about market demand for fertilizer in the chongqing area , or the reasonable utilization of natural gas resources , or the economic benefits of enterprises are concerned .
moreover , this corporation is also planning to construct an ethylene factory with natural gas as its raw material through co - operating with foreign companies , and will annually produce 300,000 tons of ethylene . this project has invested around 6 billion yuan rmb , and upon completion , will change the state of transferring almost all the needed chemical raw materials from other places to the areas of chongqing and sichuan .
binggang zhu said that during the " ninth five - year - plan " period , the total investment of china petroleum and natural gas corporation in oil and gas prospecting to develop the upper reaches of the yangtze river will reach 10 billion yuan in the area of chongqing .
after approval of the natural gas chemical industry project , more than 10 billion yuan will be further invested in construction .
this is more than the sum invested in the past 40 years .
he said that while the gas consumption of sichuan province and chongqing municipality is guaranteed , the project also takes into consideration the co - ordination with the construction of the three gorges project , which has attracted world - wide attention . it can transport part of the gas commodity to other provinces and cities , and will gradually connect with china 's other natural gas pipes to form a national natural gas pipe network .

china 's pharmaceutical enterprises , which mainly produce large amount of medicines used as raw materials and imitate foreign chemical medicines over a long period of time , will accelerate the development of new medicines and technologies with their own intellectual property rights .
an official from the state pharmaceutical administration bureau said that , starting this year , financial aid for the research of innovative medicines will be further increased , and state - owned funds would give investment priority to the fields of high technology and innovated medical products .
this year , the state pharmaceutical administration bureau will evaluate and decide the top 50 enterprises in the pharmaceutical industry according to new criteria . total annual sales revenue is predicted to be more than 60 % of the whole country 's medicine sales revenue .
at the same time , 3 - 5 % of each enterprise 's annual sales revenue will be used for the research and development of new medicines .
this official said that , at the same time , the state should also guide foreign capital to invest in new technologies , new products and medicine projects in the midwest area , to give impetus to national medicine enterprises to improve products ' technical content and enhance competitiveness in the international market .
china now has about 3,500 pharmaceutical enterprises , which produce 1,350 kinds of medicines used as raw materials and 4,000 kinds of chinese herbal medicines each year , and is the second largest producing and exporting country of medicines used as raw materials , second only to america .
but due to science and technology content being low , the product 's sales price on the international market is 20 - 30 % lower than the normal price , and can only return more than 1 billion us dollars in foreign currency each year .
while in 1996 , importing pharmaceutical preparations alone consumed funds surpassing 1.1 billion us dollars in china .
now , in china , there are less than 3,000 full time personnel engaging in the research of innovated medicines , only corresponding to personnel on the regular payroll of the research department of merck pharmaceutical company of the us .
experts urge that china 's pharmaceutical industry should change methods of focusing on the production of medicines used as raw materials , while paying less attention to development of preparations , and catching up with development trends of the global pharmaceutical industry as soon as possible .
it was learned that , the national project of new medicines and industrialized development , jointly promoted by departments of the state science commission , the ministry of public health , the state pharmaceutical administration bureau , etc. , is now being implemented . by the end of this century , ten new patent protected medicines are planned to be developed and five new medicine selecting centers , five medication safety assessing centers and five medication clinic experimentation centers will be built .

kazuo nakamura , director of research at japan 's dai - ichi kangyo bank , said here today that the real growth rate of the world economy in 1998 will be about 3 % .
kazuo nakamura , at a public lecture jointly organized by beijing 's wu jia economic consulting company , lt. and japan 's dai - ichi kangyo bank , made a report concerning the new year 's world economic and financial situation .
after he reviewed the world economic and financial situation of ' 97 , he said that due to the economic growth in asia , including japan , further slowing down , the economic growth of america , even though its current economic activity is relatively good , and of other countries will also feel a very large effect .
compared with the rapid growth of the past , the world economy has entered a period of adjustment .
he forecast that the real growth rate for the world economy this year would fall from the 3.9 % of ' 97 down to 3 % .
nakamura thought that the rate of economic growth of asia 's countries and regions , with korea and thailand being the most prominent , would slide downward to a large extent .
but , he said , for these countries the currencies already have devalued to a great degree , exports have recovered , and imports could decrease .
he estimated that the rate of economic growth in asean would be about 4.5 percent .
nakamura said that the japanese economy exhibited negative growth in the year ' 97 , and that in ' 98 , if it didn ' t adopt good economic policies , the economy would continue to be in negative growth .
he said further that china 's economic growth would also slow in speed , feeling the effects of the economies of japan and asia being depressed and of the devaluation of these countries ' currencies .
but because china 's usual income and expenditures show a favorable balance , and in addition it has over 100 billion us dollars in foreign exchange reserves , it isn ' t likely to sink into the crisis like the other asian nations .

in the past few decades , although housing was always a top matter of expense for china 's countryside residents , but in the cities and towns , however , housing was treated as an employee benefit , freely allocated by work units , and only needing extremely low rent to be submitted every month .
in 1994 , after the " state council 's decision to deepen city and township housing system reform " was announced , city and township employee housing started to take steps in the direction of threefold common responsibility , namely the state , the collective and the individual .
an obvious sign of this is the housing accumulation fund system starting to be commonly established .
according to what was revealed at the working forum on housing reform work in some provinces and cities held in beijing recently , currently the total amount of national accumulation funds surpassed 80 billion yuan . this huge accumulation fund is playing an increasingly obvious role in supporting individuals to purchase housing and housing construction .
at the same time , there has been a big increase in the nation 's monthly rent of public housing in cities and townships , with some regions increasing to account for about 10 % of the income of dual income families .
although the pace of housing reform is being accelerated , the old method of allocating housing through benefits has still has not been broken through .
according to a recent survey conducted among residents of 5 cities , namely beijing , shanghai , tianjin , chongqing and guangzhou , relying on work units to allocate housing still remains the main avenue of residential housing in these 5 cities .
in shanghai , 62.4 % of the residents currently still have housing still under work unit allocation .
yunfa zhu and yanqun zhang , economic scholars of china 's social science institute , said : " monetizing housing allocation is a large trend " .
its central content is to abolish benefit housing allocation , and at the same time to increase housing expense amounts in employee salaries .
director of the city and township construction committee , junmin wang , who is in charge of the housing reform work of shandong province , believes that although the aim of housing reform is to realize " residents have their own houses " and housing commercialization , yet considering government financial strength , the condition of enterprise operations , and the level of employee incomes , at present , still only selling houses and renting houses at cost can be put into practice .
junmin wang said that if the money from employees paying rent is used to pay a mortgage , with housing subsidies and the housing accumulation fund , a dual income family purchasing a 75 square - meter , 2 bedroom , economy apartment , according to the 1996 cost price , will need 12 years . if loans such as mortgages , guarantees and installments , etc. , are also utilized to pay , employees can definitely afford it .
if a one - time housing subsidy is also used , the economic environment of employees buying houses will be eased even more .
it was learned that china currently has about 66 million square meters of commercial housing overstocked .
financial departments have been requested to develop employee personal housing mortgage and loan business to increase their purchasing ability .
last year , the size of the china construction bank and the industrial and commerce bank 's personal housing mortgages and loans increased to 10 billion yuan .
concerned departments also cancelled some fee items so as to lower housing construction costs .
when analyzing and forecasting this year 's economy , beijing economists recently said that accelerating starting the city and township housing expenses will possibly cause the housing industry to become a new growth point of the domestic economy in 1998 .

the white paper , " regarding the china - us balance of trade problem " , announced by china 's state department news office today , pointed out that the unreasonableness of trade statistics determined according to the original site of manufacture principle was where the essence lay in america 's trade deficit with china being seriously exaggerated , and in the sino - american trade balance situation being distorted .
the white paper said that because of a lack of unified original production site rules , each country , when formulating its own original production site rule , often starts out from the needs of its own country , and standards differ , degrees of strictness vary , and randomness sometimes exists in assessing the original production site of imported goods .
the white paper said that now , because economic trade relationships among countries in the world develop rapidly , cross - national investments increase daily , exchanges in international trade are no longer goods produced in an individual country , but " world products " crossing national boundaries .
methods of calculating export trade according to current original production sites , make it obviously difficult to accurately reflect general trends in changes in world economic development . it could even distort the balance of trade situation among countries .
in the past two to three decades , rapid development in the processing trade in some countries and regions had increased the complexity of this problem .
the white paper said , since the 90 's , one of the important ingredients of the growth of china 's foreign trade exports was the expansion of processing trade exports .
china 's processing trade was mainly developed from the transfer of labor - intensive manufacturing industries or work processes from developed countries such as the us , japan , etc. and countries and regions such as singapore , korea , hong kong , taiwan , etc. , in order to reduce production costs and raise competitiveness .
its products rely on original sales channels , transferring from places like hong kong , etc. to traditional markets such as the us etc .
by original production site rule statistics , product exporting countries shifted from these countries and regions to china .
the white paper said that in recent years , two thirds of china 's exports to the us were transferred out through the hong kong region .
these products ' value - added rates in hong kong are far higher than the value - added rates in mainland china . hong kong 's actual benefits are far higher than mainland china .
if hong kong 's larger value - added portions are counted as hong kong 's exports , then china 's trade surplus with the us could correspondingly decrease , even becoming a deficit .
the white paper thereby drew the conclusion and held that , when using original production site statistics , its limitations must be fully recognized , superficial figures must be seen through , and the actual benefit that each party achieves from trade must be seriously analyzed .
this will then help to eliminate misunderstanding , and appropriately solve trade disputes between countries .
at the same time , one must also consider the increasingly growing trend of increasingly close international economic interaction and international investment , service trade , etc. , improve and perfect trade statistical methods , make statistical data objective and realistic , create good conditions for mutually beneficial co - operation among various countries of the world and healthy development of world economic trade .

yuan chen , vice president of the people 's bank of china , delivered a written speech at the 48th meeting of the temporary committee of the international monetary fund organization here on the 28th . he called for all countries in the world to strengthen co - operation and to promote the continuous development of the world economy .
he said that in 1996 world economic growth had some acceleration , that the pressure of global inflation was further reduced , and that the level of world economy integration significantly increased .
but the long - term continuous development of the world economy still faces quite a lot of macro - economic imbalance factors and structural obstacles . apart from each country 's efforts to mainly depend on itself , strengthening international co - operation will help to eliminate stumbling factors in the growth of the world economy .
he pointed out that in some european industrial countries current economy lagging is mainly due to structural obstacles such as over - burdened social welfare systems and the ossification of labor markets that have been existing for a long time , etc .
accelerating the pace of structural reform will not only be beneficial to promoting the economic recovery of these countries and the development of the european economy and currency union , but will also have active effects on the continuous growth of the world economy .
other industrial countries should also make use of the present opportunity while the economic situation is still good to reduce budget deficits and increase the dynamics of structural reform .
yuan chen believed that because most of the developing countries are actively promoting structural reform and adopting measures to stabilize their economy , these countries as a unified body have maintained a growth rate of above 6 % for 5 years running . moreover , they have good prospects to continue to maintain such a strong growth trend .
the contribution of developing countries to the development of the world economy is increasingly large . the degree of contact with one another and with other countries in the world is increasing , and the disparities in economic growth between regions appear to be on a narrowing trend .
at the same time yuan chen emphasized that economic development among the developing countries is still not even . the economy in many countries is still very fragile . their debts are still heavy and the poverty situation is worsening . in the spirit of development and co - operation , the international community should adopt realistic and feasible measures to help these developing countries solve these problems .
he said that in recent years the signs of globalization of the world economy are becoming more and more obvious , and that the world economy has been greatly pushed towards prosperity .
the unification of the world economy is intensifying with each passing day . facing the challenges brought by globalization , each country should continuously implement sound economic policies and deepen structural reform so as to enjoy the most benefits from the process of globalization and to minimize the negative effects .
yuan chen also pointed out that what causes worry is that some industrial countries take labor standards , environment and human rights , etc. , as excuses to frequently adopt trade protection measures . this severely affects the future of world economy and trade .
on the other hand , there are still a number of developing countries that have not benefited from the progress of globalization .
in this connection , he appealed to the industrial countries to eliminate obstacles to the progress of the globalization of the world economy as soon as possible .
on behalf of the chinese government he welcomed the participants to hong kong , china , in september of this year to attend the next meeting and the 1997 annual meeting of the temporary committee of the international monetary fund organization .

on december 26th of last year , the " hubei daily " released a group of articles , naming and criticizing a comrade at a village broadcasting station for fabricating a news release , " guofu ba hits a roadblock " . it also released an editorial article pointing out that sticking to principles of authenticity in news reporting is an excellent tradition in party journalism .
similar false and partially false news items have been seen not only in the " hubei daily " , but also other newspapers , tv and radio have had such news .
although false news is rare , the influence is extremely bad .
if there is one false piece of news out of 100 pieces , readers will suspect the other 99 pieces .
the chinese communist party is a party that maintains the principle of being practical and realistic . party journalism should also follow the principle of being practical and realistic .
regardless of whether you are a professional journalist or an amateur , regardless of whether reporting good news or reporting bad news , all of it needs to be true .
there are a lot of reasons for causing news to be inconsistent with facts , most are subjective reasons .
the " hubei daily " published that comrade 's self - criticism . he said , " in order to get a good appraisal at the end of the year , i changed the time and place of incidents which happened or i had witnessed in the past , and fudged such scenarios as ' the director general of revenue insists on giving guofu ba a reward of 50 yuan ' and ' guofu ba 's child was ill and needed money urgently ' , etc. "
his desire for being appraised well is understandable , but should have taken the right road .
moreover , press organizations should strictly check , and especially look out for those " related articles " .
so , to punish false news , some practical measures must be taken , exposing it in the papers is very effective .
false news can fool readers for a period of time , but eventually the writers fool themselves .
to welcome the illuminating 70th anniversary of the birth of the chinese communist party , essays solicited on " on the position of party branch secretary " meet with readers today .
the opening page wrote about the party branch secretary of jiujianpeng village of pingyi county of shandong province .
this village is situated on top of a high mountain , from the origin of the name of the village , one can imagine the bad natural conditions and the difficult life of the masses .
in the past , when people from below the mountain came to visit relatives in this village , the best gift to bring was a can of water .
after several years of diligent struggle , this place has changed appearance .
electric lamps light up the village , wide roads are built on steep cliffs , deserted mountains have turned green , fruit is in abundance .
the key to this change happening is there is a good party branch who leads the masses to cure poverty and make wealth . there is jiakun liu who was accredited as an " excellent member of the communist party " of the province and a " labor model of the entire country " , acting as the party branch secretary .
he works for the masses and firstly , is not afraid of suffering loss , secondly , is not afraid of hardship , and thirdly , is not afraid of being blamed .
these " three do not fears " are a demonstration of the spirit of communism .
the grassroots organization of the party is the fighting fortress of the party among society 's grassroots organizations , is a political kernel for uniting the vast masses to fight for the thorough implementation of lines , guidelines , and policies of the party .
party branches have a lot of work to do . the branch secretary , being the leading person , must possess multi - faceted talents , but most importantly must have the communist spirit of serving the people in his heart and soul .
with this spirit , the party organization will be able to plant roots among the masses , will be able to lead the masses to overcome all types of difficulties , move mountains to fill seas , work well in areas such as agriculture , industry , commerce , education according to policies and decrees of the party and the nation , lead soldiers well , be a good cadre , and make contributions to the socialist modernization undertaking .
the purpose of this newspaper opening this special column is to spread this type of utterly valuable spirit , introduce working experience of party branch secretaries , and contribute a portion of strength for promoting the construction of grassroots organizations of the party .

one kind of situation embarrassed the judges , namely , that some works displayed really beautifully written characters , conformed to a certain calligraphy style , and showed signs of new achievement in art form , but regretfully , because the calligraphers have poor basic knowledge , they wrote some wrong characters , and since there was no remedy , finally lost in the selection .
everyone both felt pity for them , and felt that this is an issue very worth worrying about .
some young calligraphy lovers , just at the time when they should have been studying hard , were hindered . so basic knowledge was not enough , structure was not systematic , and the level was rather low . they have some ability in calligraphy , but eventually cannot produce a final masterpiece at a higher level , and cannot create works which may be used as teaching models .
we sincerely hope that these friends will amend this aspect quickly , and hope future works will show both superior capability in calligraphy , and convey healthy and deep thoughts , and even reveal a clear , meaningful and elegant mind .
this is the eager expectation that many older - generation calligraphers have placed on us younger - generation .

" chrysanthemum - 6 " , a large scientific experiment satellite launched by japan , has no hope of entering geosynchronous orbit .
yutaka kawashima , chief of the science and technology department , while proclaiming this news of failure to numerous journalists today , expressed her profound regrets and apologized to the whole japanese people .
she said that " a huge amount in appropriations was spent for research and development on the satellite , yet it has become floatsam floating in the universe ; but we still hope that this satellite can be utilized to the largest extent . "
yutaka kawashima also suggested that the universe development undertaking group organize an inspection team to thoroughly ascertain the reason why the satellite could not enter geosynchronous orbit .
according to preliminary investigations by concerned parties , the cause of the failure was that the satellite 's apogee engine was unable to normally operate because of a breakdown in the fuel valve .
after the " chrysanthemum - 6 " satellite was sent into elliptical orbit by an " h2 - 2 " rocket on the afternoon of august 28th , it was originally planned to send it into geosynchronous orbit gradually by firing the satellite 's apogee engine 3 times , this interval requiring around 1 month 's time .
however , the japanese universe development undertaking group , which took responsibility for the launch , continued to remotely control the satellite on august 30th and 31st many times but suffered repeated failures .
the " chrysanthemum - 6 " satellite , weighing 2 tons and with a 30 - meter - long board of solar powered batteries , is the biggest satellite ever launched by japan so far .
moreover , this satellite is equipped with necessary electrical machinery and sensors . japan originally planned to use it to conduct the world 's first multimedia communication experiments , such as optical communication , etc .
the japanese universe development undertaking group believed that if this satellite 's experiment was successful , japan would henceforth enter an age of using large satellites like advanced countries in europe and america .
therefore , a sum of 41.5 billion yen was put into the development of this satellite .
this time completely and greatly delayed japan 's universe development undertaking process , and many programs need to be changed .

this is another big discovery coming after an abundance of precious dinosaur eggs fossils were discovered here at the beginning of last year .
this reporter has learnt from the archaeological institute of cultural relics that at the beginning of april of this year , related experts discovered several hundred dinosaur bone fossils , including ribs , phalanges , etc. , between two river gravel layers at such places as hutou hill , yangcheng township , xixia county , etc .
because of long - term exposure at the ground 's surface , some are already broken .
from the view of stratigraphy , they all belong to the cretaceous period .
according to experts ' judgment , a large quantity of dinosaurs fossils and other species ' fossils are still buried within the dinosaur fossil group distribution area .
they believe that the discovery of a large quantity of valuable dinosaur eggs fossils in the xixia basin is an international rarity , and egg fossils and bone fossils existing in one place is even rarer .
this find is of great important significance for studying dinosaur classification in the xixia area , probing into dinosaur zoology and breeding habits , restoring the zoology and ecology of the dinosaur era and revealing laws about the earth 's surface changing and the earth 's environment evolving .
the discovery of the dinosaur bone fossils also provides important clues about the region and burial patterns for further searching for dinosaur fossils .

president zemin jiang will soon be visiting russia , the ukraine and france .
recently , he was respectively interviewed by reporters from russia and france at the fangfei garden of the diaoyutai state guest house , and answered questions on the sino - russian , sino - french relations , and regional , international issues .
when a reporter asked about the present situation of sino - russian relations and the prospects of co - operation , president zemin jiang said that relations between the countries of china and russia have been developing smoothly in the areas of politics , economy and trade , science and technology , education , culture , etc. , in the past 3 years , especially after president yeltsin 's visit to china at the end of 1992 .
both countries have maintained high level contact and relations ; negotiations on border divisions have achieved important results and significant progress has been made in disarmament negotiations at the border regions .
trade volume has exceeded the highest historical levels of sino - russian trade for two years running . china and russia have become important mutual trade partners .
he said that " the two countries of china and russia are close neighbors . i think that the people of the two countries , namely china and russia are happy about the development of relations between the two countries . "
zemin jiang said to russian reporters : " at the invitation of president yeltsin , i will be visiting your beautiful country in two days .
together with president yeltsin and other russian leaders , i will explore establishing friendly , neighborly and mutual , co - operative sino - russian relations that will extend into the 21st century so as to raise the co - operation of the two countries in various areas to a new level . "
when a reporter asked whether the fact that now a large number of chinese citizens overstay short - term visas after entering russia will become a factor in tense relations between china and russia and how this problem should be solved , zemin jiang expressed that with the continuous development of friendly , neighborly relations between china and russia in recent years , the two countries are no longer isolated from each other , and relations between them have expanded , with rapidly increasing staff contacts . this process is very natural .
he said that " because necessary legislation and measures cannot keep up with demands of the situation and development , certain phenomena of disorder occur , especially in contact at the border regions , resulting in some passive influences .
we hold that this type of situation is not good and should be improved and stopped .
in recent days , the situation has improved to a certain extent because both sides have co - operated in the adoption of some measures . "
zemin jiang said that " we should not ' stop eating because of a hiccup ' .
i hold that this is a problem that appears while relations between the two countries are being developed , and that if both china and russia take sincere , friendly , calm and realistic attitudes towards a joint effort , these problems can be solved appropriately , and that they are not , nor can they be factors of tense sino - russian relations . "
speaking of the reason for the decrease in the volume of trade between china and russia so far this year , zemin jiang said that " we have noticed that compared to the same period last year , there is a drop in the volume of trade between the two countries , china and russia , in the first half of this year .
the reasons for the drop are manifold : both china and russia are implementing economic reforms , and there are changes in demands for each other 's goods ; changes in the visa system have also brought some effects in contacts between traders of both sides .
in international trade , increases and decreases in trade volume happen frequently .
i believe that the drop in the volume of trade between china and russia is only a temporary phenomenon .
through joint efforts of both sides in encouraging large , powerful and reputable companies from each country to develop co - operation , trade between both countries will develop even more healthily .
there is no doubt that issues in this area will be within the scope of talks between the leaders of both countries . "
when interviewed by french reporters , zemin jiang said that " the situation in the development of relations between china and france has been very good since their normalization this year .
prime minister barisque visited china in april , and now at the invitation of president mitterrand i will be carrying out a visit to france for national affairs .
trade relations between the two countries have also more quickly reached normalization and development .
in the first half of this year , french exports to china increased by 42.2 % compared with the same period last year . "
zemin jiang pointed out that china and france are strongly complementary to each other in economy , and that development prospects are good .
both sides have quite a lot of identical or similar viewpoints on international issues .
he said that " i believe that as long as both sides make joint efforts , friendly co - operative relations between the two countries will definitely continue to develop on the principles of the sino - french communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations and the joint communique issued on january 12th this year . "
when reporters asked about north korea 's nuclear issue and china 's role , zemin jiang emphasized that there are two goals china is seeking on this issue : to maintain the peace and stability of the korean peninsula and to realize a non - nuclear region in the korean peninsula .
we welcome the preliminary results achieved by the talks between the us and north korea , and have been playing an active role . "
when answering the question on whether china 's government is hoping for contact with each country in europe , or wants to have contact with the european union , zemin jiang said that " china is willing to have contact with each country in europe and also develop friendly co - operative relations with the european union . i think that these two are mutually exclusive . "
when a reporter asked to what level contacts with taiwan could be extended by a country that maintains diplomatic relations with china , zemin jiang emphasized that all countries that have established diplomatic relations with china have expressed their admission that the people 's republic of china is the only legal government representing all of china , and that taiwan is an inseparable part of china . they promised not to establish official relations or have contact with taiwan that is of an official nature .
he said that we have no objections to economic and trade relations kept between france and taiwan that are purely people - to - people .

today , the association of the relationship between the two sides of the straits sent a letter to the foundation for the exchange across the straits to exchange views on the matters of life and property loss of mainland compatriots and taiwanese compatriots .
the communique said that on april 12th the straits association director expressed that the straits association agreed in principle , after both sides implement necessary preparations , to exchange views about the matter of contact and exchange between both sides of the straits concerning life and property loss of mainland compatriots and taiwanese compatriots in recent years .
the straits association holds that , now , both sides should first agree on topics and content of exchanging views , and then come back to consider issues such as staff levels and time , place , etc .
if both sides cannot reach an agreement on topics and content , it would not be possible to find common points in exchanging views . this type of discussion is not what compatriots from both sides are happy to see .
the straits association believes that the content of the exchange of views should include :
firstly , to exchange views on the issues of tourism and contact on both sides of the straits , including travel safety issues of compatriots from both sides .
as early as the first working discussion , at the end of august of last year , when the two associations implemented the " wang - gu talks " , the straits association put forward in the " schedule for the discussion on implementing relevant agreements of the wang - gu talks " that the associations should conduct specific discussions about " issues on strengthening tourism and contact on both sides " as soon as possible , but so far the straits foundation 's response has not been received .
secondly , the straits association persistently advocates completely implementing discussions of topics about routine and economy , science and technology stipulated in the " common agreement of the wang - gu talks " , and has suggested many times to the straits foundation that discussions on the " rights of taiwanese merchants investing in the mainland and related issues " should be started early .
our association holds that the personal and property safety of taiwanese merchants investing in the mainland have legal safeguards , and if the straits foundation felt it was needed , it could exchange views while discussing " rights of taiwanese merchants investing in the mainland and related issues " .
thirdly , the straits association has repeatedly requested that both associations should conduct consultative discussions on issues of the taiwanese military killing and wounding mainland coastal fishermen and causing serious life and property losses in recent years .
since establishing the straits association , it has continuously pointed out such inhumane behavior to the straits foundation which seriously hurts feelings of compatriots of both sides and breaks the harmonious atmosphere on both sides , so as to attract the attention of relevant taiwanese areas on compensating for losses , finding those responsible , and severely punishing the assailants . it has appealed to stop such violence at the root through negotiation between the two associations .
however , up to now , the straits foundation 's response has not been received .
the communique clearly points out that in the above issues involving rights of compatriots of both sides of the straits in contact and exchange , personal safety is included , so as for the long delay in starting discussions , the fault is not with the straits association .
the communique says that current methods of contact and co - operation between the two associations must strictly follow the " regulation agreement of contact and talks between the two associations " signed last year .
since the " qiandao lake incident " occurred , the straits association has , according to the agreement , reported the situation to the straits foundation , explaining and answering a certain number of questions and requests brought up by the straits foundation .
however , the straits foundation has repeatedly raised demands that exceed the above agreement of the two associations . despite being reminded by the straits association , the straits foundation still repeatedly persists . this is a practice that disrespects the agreement between the two associations .
it is continually hoped that the contact and co - operation of the two associations can be conducted in accordance with the current agreement .
the communique points out that as far as the " qiandao lake incident " is concerned , the top priority is investigating and settling the case in accordance with the law .
at the same time , to express further goodwill , the straits association has proactively invited the straits foundation and relevant experts to come to zhejiang . the straits association will arrange experts ' to be presented with the details of the incident and reply to questions .
if the straits foundation is willing to know the details of this case and sincerely understands the feelings of dependents of those who perished , then it is difficult to understand why it again sets up prerequisites ?
the straits association again reaffirms the above invitation , and hopes that the straits foundation would soon provide the date of its departure and the name list .
according to relevant sources , currently , the three suspected criminals have been arrested , and a trial will soon be carried out according to legal procedure .

chinese scientists have successively discovered ten archaeopteryx - type fossils in the beipiao region of liaoxi this year .
this find has attracted attention from home and abroad , and has been called " one of the most important finds since archaeopteryx fossils were found in germany in 1862 " .
in 1862 at the earliest finding of archaeopteryx in the state of bavaria , germany , it stirred the whole world .
over the past 100 years , the world has discovered altogether 8 archaeopteryx findings from the same period , and only confined to this area .
today , the archaeopteryx - type fossils china discovered are close to and similar in age , form and structure to germany 's archaeopteryx -- it was approximately 142.5 million years or more ago and belonged to the mesozoic oxfordian . they are a rich source of material . there are not only completely preserved skulls and wings but also waist belts , back limbs and several feathers .
experts and scholars from home and abroad are greatly focusing on this important discovery .
professor austern of yale university in the us , an authoritative scholar on the research issues of the origin of birds of the world , a few days ago , in his letter of congratulation to the ancient birds institute of the chinese academy of sciences , expressed intense interest .
relevant scholars in china 's geology circles said that this discovery has added new evidence to determining geological ages .
chinese ornithological experts , however , think that this important find has very important significance in the study of the origin of birds and ancient biology research . it not only adds a new member to the ancient birds but also widens the geographical distribution of the earliest birds , especially , puts forth a new challenge to today 's various hypotheses of the protracted debate on the origin of birds .
according to information , china , in recent years , has successively discovered bird fossils from the early mesozoic period in provinces such as gansu , hebei , inner mongolia , liaoning , etc. this period was mostly in the early cretaceous age .
however , this find of archaeopteryx fossils are from a much earlier age , lower in stratus and more primitive in features than previously discovered archaeopteryx .
in view of this , the world places hopes of tracing the more primitive and more ancient , true ancestor of birds in china , and chinese scientists also expressed possibly discovering fossils of birds earlier than the archaeopteryx in china .
according to another report , chinese scientists have temporarily named this type of archaeopteryx fossil " the divine land archaeopteryx " .
currently , they are performing further study on these fossils .

israel 's foreign minister , shimon peres , said that china , by persevering in going its own way , and concentrating its efforts on conquering poverty set an example for the people of every country of the middle east .
this is what peres said in the preface he composed especially for the chinese edition of his just published new work " the new middle east . "
peres said : " china and israel are at the two ends of asia , separated by ' ten thousand crags and torrents . '
yet the people of our two countries nevertheless are similar to one another .
the great chinese people offered up to the world cultural riches on the spiritual plane and material plane .
if these riches didn ' t exist , people would not be able to describe the course of history . "
he said in addition : " we who live in western asia are gazing at the east with a look of hope and reverence .
china has already demonstrated to the entire world that the strategy for resolving the question of poverty in society lies in carrying out a plan that has been reasoned out and in concentrating strength towards a task that has a reasonable hope of success . ......
china still believes in the path that it itself has specified .
in the past it has not yielded to any pressure from outside , and now it still unswervingly defends the right to determine its own future for itself . "
the book " the new middle east " originally was published as an english edition around the end of autumn last year .
the author starts the discussion from september of that year with israel 's signing the declaration of principles of palestinian autonomy with the palestine liberation organization , and looks back at the complex struggles of the middle east over the past several hundred years , especially the most recent half century . he expresses his views on building a new middle east in the future .
in the preface to the chinese edition , peres says that the leaders of every country must have vision , relinquish old grudges , and create peace in order to deal with " challenges of tomorrow . "
he points out , " at a time when we are on the threshold of the 21st century , warfare no longer has any use .
the important problems we are up against are how to conquer poverty and scarcity . "
to do this , he emphasized , " we must control the desert that is day - by - day eroding arable land , develop new sources of water , and carry out new engineering projects . "
peres pointed out that these goals are not likely to be realized easily . they require a sensible attitude and a dedicated spirit .
he observed , " china has already demonstrated that it could conquer poverty and the misery that generations of people have suffered .
we hope that china becomes a model that the people of all middle eastern countries , including both israelis and arabs , can imitate on the road that we walk together heading towards the future .
the chinese edition of the book " the new middle east " has already recently been published and distributed through xinhua publishing .

here , today , the zijin mountain astronomical observatory under china 's academy of science , issued the specific forecasted time to observe shoemaker - levy 9 comet 's collision with jupiter from china . this provides a rare opportunity for chinese astronomers and amateurs to observe this astronomic phenomenon of rare human experience .
the shoemaker - levy 9 comet , which was discovered by us astronomers in march 1993 , has now split into 21 nuclei and has been moving at high speed towards jupiter . it will collide with jupiter and explode in july .
this is the first forecast of a magnificent collision phenomenon between celestial bodies of the solar system in human history .
on the basis of international observations , forecast data , and many years of their own research observations and precise calculations concerning asteroids and comets , planet research experts at the zijin mountain astronomical observatory of nanjing recently forecasted the specific time for observing this astronomic phenomenon from china .
the collision of the 21 comet nuclei will last for five and a half days .
according to astronomy experts of the zijin mountain astronomical observatory , the speed at the time of collision between the 21 nuclei and jupiter will be as high as 60 km / s .
among them , the diameters of the 11 larger nuclei range from 2 to 4 kilometers . the energy of the explosion at collision time will reach as high as 10 trillion tons of tnt dynamite , equivalent to the explosive power of 500 million atomic bombs similar to those dropped on hiroshima . a colossal fireball and soaring mushroom cloud may be formed in jupiter 's atmosphere whose projectiles would be thrown to a height of several thousand kilometers .
astronomers stressed that the collision between the comet and jupiter will be 770 to 780 million kilometers away from the earth , corresponding to 5 times the distance between the sun and the earth , and therefore will impose no direct impact on the earth .
according to astronomy experts , the observation and study of this comet colliding with jupiter will help both the in - depth revelation of jupiter 's mysteries of the rosy clouds , the great red spot , and corona and also help in developing research on the odds , forecast accuracy and explosive effects , etc. of comets and asteroids ' collision with earth .

xinhua news agency , bonn , august 31st short commentary : termination of the post - war historical period in europe , by reporter zhimian xia
russian troops held the last ceremony to bid farewell to germany on the 31st .
soldiers from three countries , namely , the us , uk and france will also withdraw from berlin in early september .
the occupying armies existing in german territory will end soon .
on september 1st , 1939 , hitler 's army attacked poland . it has just been 55 years now since the second world war ii which brought great suffering to the people of europe and the world .
a total of four million people from european countries died in this war , including those from germany .
among them , the ussr made a great sacrifice in the war to win over german invaders . its casualties were nearly 28 million .
half a century has passed in a flash , with europe experiencing hot war , cold war , turmoil and tremendous changes .
currently , both the hot and cold wars have passed , but the end of turmoil and conflict is not yet to be seen .
in the early period after the war , the four large countries , namely the ussr , the us , the uk and france , carved out their spheres of influence in accordance with the " yalta agreement " , and occupied germany and its capital by districts .
the highest policy - making authorities in germany then were the " control committee of the allied states " .
henceforth , germany was split up and in a powerless state for a long period .
not long after , the contest between the us and the ussr in europe caused a split in the original anti - fascist coalition , resulting in german 's division into two .
on the western side , the us organized nato and supported west germany for the purpose of keeping the ussr " in check " ; on the eastern side , the ussr organized the warsaw pact , and built up east germany as the bridgehead against the west .
germany , being split up , became the frontline of the cold - war confrontation between the east and west .
henceforth , there has not been a single day of peace in the political situation of europe , a crisis - ridden continent .
but , since the start of 1989 , a new turn has occurred in the european situation .
radical changes in eastern europe , the re - unification of germany , the dissolution of the warsaw pact and the disintegration of the ussr all occurred successively , causing difficulties in continuing the original " yalta system " .
the rise of a re - unified germany has changed the proportion of strength in europe , making the uk and france , which originally were large world powers , worry about dropping to second - class big countries .
the us , the only superpower today , has recently started to regard germany as a " partner in leadership " , encouraging it to " exercise a leadership role " in world politics . the reason is obvious : the us wants to make use of germany 's strength .
a unified germany is moving today from a large economic country to a large political country .
depending on its own tremendous strength , germany is playing a leading role in the european union , and its role as a " giant " is obviously seen by common people .
it spares no efforts in playing a " bridging role " between eastern and western europe and participating in the " peacekeeping mission " under the banner of the united nations , and is striving to be a permanent member country of the united nations security council .
currently , the historical post - war period is drawing to an end .
but the lesson of blood and tears and the painful experience it left for later generations still needs to continue and earnestly conclude .

xinhua news agency , washington , august 30th . news analysis : why us company takeovers are growing in intensity .
xinhua news agency , by reporter nan wang
lockheed and martin - marietta , two old - brand military industrial corporations of the us , announced merging on the 30th , forming the us 's largest defense equipment contractor corporation .
lockheed company and martin company are additional participants in the growing trend of takeovers and mergers of us companies in the last few months .
this trend has spread widely to pharmaceutical and medical instrument companies , telecommunication and high - tech companies as well as retail , banks and railway companies , etc .
according to the statistics of " time " magazine , from january to july this year , the asset value of takeovers announced by us companies was as high as 171.6 billion us dollars increasing by about half over the same period last year .
within that , in the first 7 months of this year , takeovers and mergers in total announced by four big us industries , medical treatment , media , telecommunications and banking , reached 1062 , accounting for one fourth of all takeovers . regardless of whether it is the number of takeover companies or the value of takeover assets , both exceeded or were close to the peak of us company takeovers in the late ' 80 's .
observers here hold that since 1994 , reasons for the us company takeover trend differ from those of the past . firstly , the general trend of globalization of the world economy compels companies to expand scale and combine businesses , increase their overall competitive strength and to reduce costs . secondly , the clinton government 's thoughts and actions in constructing the information highway , adjusting the financial industry and reforming the medical insurance system compels related companies to make strategic adjustments .
moreover , the white house 's attitude towards anti - trust laws is somewhat more relaxed than before .
taking the pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies as an example , reforms of hospitals expanding scales of purchasing medicine and medical treatment equipment , and thus reducing unit costs and expanding services , have spread throughout the country .
that the columbia medical company purchased two hospital groups within one month last year , thus integrating pharmaceuticals , medical treatment and sales , is one such example .
for telecommunications companies , the merger of telephone companies with cable tv and wireless communications companies frequently is to mutually complement one another in operations and to dominate the market .
recently , the us congress passed an inter - state banking law , allowing regional banks to operate in other states . handholding among banks is also to reduce overlapping services so as to reduce costs , to strengthen base assets , and expand credit scales .
for military industry enterprises , the merger of lockheed and martin and the combination of two old - brand corporations , namely northrop and grumman , are both due to the same reason : after the cold war , the america 's national defense expenditures gradually reduced , and the scale and strength of military industry enterprises is one of the conditions necessary for winning limited government weapons purchasing contracts .
observers here believe that company takeovers has a positive aspect , i . e . , the reduction of cost , the increase in efficiency , and the strengthening of competitive power .
but , many takeovers are obviously actions that must be taken for companies to survive .
however , history has proven that " big and complete " monopolies of production and sales is not beneficial to the national economy 's healthy development .
for instance , in the ' 70 's , mergers of us steel mills directly led to the birth of a few large - scale unified steel companies , but these companies also faced serious threats from small - scale steel mills , which are flexible in operation and advanced in technology .
moreover , company takeovers have had bad effects on consumers in terms of product quality and price , and at the same time on workers ' employment .
while voice has been given to the opinion that small enterprises are the new forces of economic growth , scaled operation of big corporations will constantly face new difficulties .

in the past two years , guangdong province has exerted itself to explore new ways of attracting talent under market economy conditions , and has been active in using market mechanisms to allocate resources of talent , and has achieved preliminary results .
" taking the first step " in guangdong 's reform and opening up in the 1980 's was closely related to the situation at that time of the " peafowl flying towards the southeast " ( human talents from all over , one after another , going to guangdong ) .
with the overall opening up of china 's coastal areas , frontier areas , riverside areas and capital cities of every province since the 1990 's , the flow of talent tends to be multi - directional and the competition has become increasingly fierce .
further enhancing the attraction to talented persons has become the key point of guangdong 's further development .
limo qin , director of the talent exchange and service center of guangdong province has done analysis and said : " the economic development rate of guangdong in 1993 was at an intermediate level of that in the recent years . in that year it introduced more than 100,000 talented persons of various types . developing at this rate , in the next ten years , not including graduates from higher education institutes , guangdong 's talent gap is conservatively estimated to surpass 1 million .
therefore , further opening minds and introducing talent are guidelines of guangdong 's policy regarding talented people . "
each year , there are several large - scale talent employment fairs whose service for more than 1000 employers and more than 10,000 applicants lasts for more than half a month .
in the whole year of 1993 , talent exchange centers of personnel departments across the province registered more than 463,000 people applying for jobs . there were 62,000 people with documents of transfer or employment processed , of which 45.8 % had intermediate or advanced level titles of specialty or profession , and 78 % had an undergraduate or higher degree .
talent introduction departments also actively went out visiting science and technology management talent .
fourteen cities such as guangzhou , shenzhen , etc. went to beijing for the first national talent and technology exchange fair , where they established a total of 100 employment booths . at the beginning of 1993 , six cities such as zhuhai , foshan , etc. also organized a delegation to advertise in the us and canada for students studying abroad . 1006 students abroad filled out application forms , and quite a number of people have successively returned to china to take jobs .
at the same time , the construction of talent market is also accelerating .
since 1991 when shenzhen established the first standing talent market , such " all - weather " talent exchange organizations have rapidly spread in the zhujiang delta and all cities within the province . now , there are fifteen cities with relatively more advanced economies in the province having built up regular markets .
in order to further enhance the attraction of talent , to break through the barrier of " departmental ownership " of talent , and to promote the flow of talent by forming mechanisms of independent employment and job choice , guangdong province has also paid greater attention to the formulation of relevant policies and regulations .
limo qin said in his introduction that in recent years the provincial government has successively issued documents such as " temporary regulations on encouraging persons studying abroad to work in guangdong " , " notices on better advertising for talent " , etc. it will soon promulgate documents such as " detailed rules for implementing temporary regulations on resignations of specialists , technicians and managers in state - owned units " and " supplementary regulations of guangdong province on the management of chinese side cadres in foreign investment enterprises " , etc .
additionally , some new methods in inviting and managing talent have been being tried in various regions .

this signifies the end of the former ussr's 49 - year post - war placement of troops in germany .
russian president yeltsin and german chancellor kohl chaired the troop withdrawal ceremony and delivered speeches .
yeltsin said that august 31st , 1994 was a turning point " for the history of russia , germany and all of europe " .

kohl held that the ultimate complete withdrawal of russian troops from germany is " the end of european post - war history " .
he said that germany's attack on the ussr on june 22nd , 1941 was not to be forgotten .
kohl emphasized that without the co - operation of the ussr , german unification would be impossible to realize .
co - operation between germany and russia just had a good beginning . " europe's safety and happiness will be guaranteed only by implementing close co - operation with russia " .
he also said that russia joined nato's peace partner relation program recently , and signed a partner relation and co - operation agreement with the european union , both of which are " important components for building up a european plaza " .
before the unification of the two germanys , the former ussr stationed about 380,000 soldiers in the former democratic republic of germany .

professor yuyi liu , a painter whose famous canvas " a happy night " caused a sensation in the art world , recently in nanjing made public a yuhua stone he had discovered - " the stone of the divine land with five unique features " .
the appearance and size of this yuhua stone is quite similar to an auspicious folk object , a longevity locket .
in the very middle of the yuhua stone is a clear image of the territory of the people 's republic of china .
the image , with its two ends towering , a sunken middle section , and the lower right part protruding , looks like a rooster craning and crowing with its neck stretched and chest thrown out ; on the side of the " rooster 's " belly is the long and narrow " taiwan island " , which is separated by " straits " ; under the claw of the " rooster " is the round " hainan island " .
the color and luster of the two " islands " are completely the same as the " mainland " .
the whole image is almost the same as the map of china .
professor yuyi liu said that he picked up the stone on the road to a yuhua stone processing plant in a suburb of nanjing five years ago , and after he returned home he carefully inspected the stone and discovered the " territory of china " on it .
according to this , yuyi liu named this stone " the stone of the divine land with five unique features " .

today , the " jerusalem post " quoted the words of shawel , director of the administrative office of the israeli foreign ministry who is now visiting the us as saying that the world bank has decided to provide 250 million us dollars of aid to palestinian autonomous authorities before the end of 1994 .
this decision broke the impasse between donor countries and palestinian autonomous authorities that had lasted for nearly one year .
at the international meeting on aiding palestinian autonomy which was held in washington on october 1st of last year , donor countries pledged to provide 2.4 billion us dollars of development aid within 5 years , of which 750 million us dollars would be appropriated in the first year .
but donor countries claimed that the palestinian autonomous region lacks necessary mechanisms for handling the aid and accounting items and therefore refused to completely fulfill this promise .
shawel said that although the us and the world bank are currently not completely satisfied with palestinian accounting work , they have still agreed to pay a portion of the funds as soon as possible .
arafat , chairman of the executive committee of the palestinian liberation organization , and other palestinian leaders have been criticizing the donor countries for not being able to keep their promise to make sure the money aid is completely in place and on time .
it is predicted that shashe , the plo 's chief negotiations representative , and rosechird , israel 's chief negotiations representative , will go to washington to specifically negotiate and determine the aid issues with the us and the world bank .

the weir group of the us recently signed an implementation agreement in beijing with jiangsu province 's electric power department to build china 's first large - capacity power plant with liquefied natural gas as fuel .
aixing dan , director of the international co - operation department of the electric power industry ministry , on this matter , expressed to xinhua news agency reporters today that if this power plant is successful , it will be a model for similar plants to be built along coastal regions .
coal , water , oil , etc. , are normally used for traditional electricity generation .
however , using liquefied natural gas as fuel for joint circulatory electricity generation has advantages of higher power generation efficiency and lower total cost , is beneficial to the environment , etc .
according to presentations , with this type of electricity generation method , a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600 degrees centigrade . this gas in turn can heat a boiler for the production of steam to turn a steam turbine which generates electricity .
at the same time , using natural gas as fuel will also reduce environmental pollution along coastal regions .
the weir group , whose headquarters is in the us , is a large , specialized corporation investing in the area of electricity generation .
the installed capacity of electricity it has invested in and developed globally has reached 15 million kilowatts .
through the contact of the yizhong company of the us , the weir group and the jiangsu electric power department reached an initial agreement on a plan to build a joint circulatory electricity generation plant .
this power plant , which will be situated in rudong , jiangsu , has an annual generation capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts . the investment amount is 2.4 billion us dollars . the chinese side holds 30 % of the shares while the weir group holds 70 % .
according to the agreement , the weir group will be responsible for the supply of natural gas from the international market for use by the power plant .
renzu luo , managing director of the weir group , is optimistic over the prospect of using liquefied natural gas as fuel for electricity generation along china 's coastal regions .
he holds that according to the experience of asian energy market development , liquefied natural gas has become the main material of clean fuel used for electricity generation . when the gross national product per capita reached 3000 us dollars in japan , south korea and taiwan , etc. , environmental protection awareness generally rose , and all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by liquefied natural gas .
as the gross national product in china 's coastal regions begins to approach this benchmark , it can be said to have had the conditions for electricity generation using natural gas in terms of financial resources .
john weir , president of the weir group who visited china with us minister brown and signed this agreement for electricity generation plant construction in jiangsu , held that now is the best time to develop a project of joint circulatory electricity generation plant with natural gas as fuel in china . both parties , the us and china , will invest more time , money and resources to make this power plant project a successful model .

a reporter asked : the standing committee of the national people 's congress had passed a resolution regarding " the three - tiered administrative system of hong kong will operate until june 30th , 1997 , and then cease . ";
then , what will the three - level chinese restructured administrative system be like ?
and when does the chinese side plan to set about preparing to construct this system ?
guofang shen said that the hk - uk three - level administrative system , namely the last hk - uk legislative council , the two municipal departments , and the district parliament will only exist till june 30th , 1997 . this is the inevitable outcome of the uk terminating its rule over hong kong at the designated time .
he said that the chinese government has repeatedly stated that the hong kong special administrative region 's first legislative assembly and regional organizations will be formed according to the basic law and relevant resolutions of the national people 's congress .
currently , the preparatory work committee of the preparatory committee of the hong kong special administrative region is studying relevant specific issues on forming the hong kong special administrative region 's first legislative assembly , and will submit suggestions to the preparatory committee that will be established in 1996 .
a reporter asked : on august 23rd , the us president signed the " 1995 financial year overseas activities fund appropriation act " in which it is stipulated that any donation made by the us to the un population fund must not be used in china . what is your opinion of this ?
guofang shen said that this bill is a bill carrying political discrimination and extremely unfriendly to china . it is an insult to china 's family planning policy , has seriously violated the mission and principles of the un charter , and sets a very bad precedent for the provision of aid to multi - lateral organizations of the un .
he pointed out that " we resolutely oppose any country providing donations with attached conditions to the population fund .
we do not hope to see the work of the un population fund receiving interference or even being diverted from its principles and mission due to pressure from the us . "

premier peng li delivered a written speech to welcome the international population and development congress .
he thinks that the chinese government 's guidelines of planning , strategizing and implementation of the population problem and socioeconomic problems as one is correct , effective in its implementation , and successful .
peng li said that in the beginning of september of this year , the united nations would hold the international population and development congress in cairo with the theme of " population , continuous economic growth and continuous development " .
this shows that the international community has increasingly recognized that population and development are inseparable , and prepare to adopt actions together .
he feels that this congress has important meaning , and the chinese government has given it high level attention and will be sending a delegation to attend the congress .
peng li said china was the most populous developing country in the world .
the chinese government included the population problem into the overall planning of the national economy and its social development , always emphasizing that population growth and economic development need to fit together , and be coordinated with resource utilization and environmental protection .
in light of china 's basic national condition , the chinese government has determined planned parenthood and environmental protection as two basic national policies , implementing a population policy and planned parenthood program that suits china 's actual needs .
at the same time , the chinese government also formulated a series of important policies and measures to realize continuous development , such as the protection of women 's legal rights and benefits , the promotion of equality among men and women , the forceful development of healthcare for women and children , the zealous elimination of poverty , and protecting the environment .
presently , the chinese economy is continuously growing , society is stable and united , people 's livelihood are continuously improving , and the population birth rate and the natural population growth rate has dropped to a lower level .
peng li said the population problem was one of the major problems currently faced by the international community .
due to differences in country 's situations , differences in economic development levels , cultural backgrounds , historical traditions , and social systems , each country should formulate suitable , effective population policies according to the actual situation of the native country .
this is the sovereignty of each country and it should receive full respect .
he said china was in a critical period of building up a socialist market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build - up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .
because of this , for a fairly long period of time , at the same time as forcefully developing the economy , china will continue to pay close attention to doing well the work of family planning .
the chinese government strongly believes that , the resolution of china 's population problem is not just being responsible for the prosperity of the chinese race and the happiness of future generations , but is also an important contribution in stabilizing the world 's population .
for this , the chinese government views with extreme importance and actively participates in international population activities , and sincerely hopes that the international community will adopt a stand of realistic resolution of population and development problems , seeking similarities while accommodating differences , co - operating closely to strive hard together towards a stable world population to create a beautiful future !

( subtitle ) the theme song of the championships is filled with poetry
the title of the theme song for the championships is very poetic . it is " water in water " .
the words and music of this song were composed by the famous italian musician claudio baglioni . at the opening ceremony , baglioni and the 60 year old tenor r . sceto , sang the theme song together .
many years ago , baglioni composed a song named " little love is as deep as the ocean " and it instantly became a popular hit throughout italy and made baglioni widely known as a popular song composer .
but , since 1992 , he has disappeared suddenly from the public eye .
when people were commenting on this , he again emerged mysteriously from obscurity and gave " water in water " to everyone which became the theme song of this world swimming championships .
baglioni has had a kind of preference for water since birth .
water is a product of nature . it has the most natural characteristics of everything .
it is an approach to life and is the headspring of consciousness , emotion and music . "
he also said , " through swimming and diving sports , we come to understand water and feel its extensiveness and power , from which arises the idea of combining with it as one .
water makes people no longer separated far away . in singing " water in water " , our hearts beat together . "
( subtitle ) the mascot " carota " is vivacious and lovely
the figure of the turtle was designed by the famous italian designer w . lonbado . its name came from an innocent and lovely little italian girl .
although a small turtle is clumsy on the beach , once in the sea , it becomes agile and free .
on the solid shell of the " little turtle " is embedded a map of the world composed of land and oceans . it implies that good swimming athletes coming from five continents and four oceans assembled together in rome to strengthen understanding and enhance friendship through competition .
xinhua news agency , beijing , september 2 : china 's handicapped sports cause is rising
xinhua news agency journalist junpu wang
the china 's handicapped sports cause has undergone the several stages of conceptualization , growth and expansion , and is currently rising .
the holding of the 6th far east and south pacific disabled games will provide more impetus for this trend .
each development step of handicapped sports cannot be separated from the concern and support of the party and the government .
at the beginning of the establishment of the people 's republic of china , social welfare services and schools for blind children and deaf people were established successively everywhere .
welfare factories developed activities such as broadcast exercises , etc. and schools established physical education .
as a part of the cause for the disabled , disabled sports began to grow .
every year , the nation allocates special funds to be used in developing handicapped sports activities .
nationwide handicapped sports games began to be held in the late 1950 's .
the games accelerated improvement and drove popularization .
the handicapped sports cause has gradually grown .
since the reform and opening up , the chinese economy has developed rapidly . this enabled more people to put money and material resource into the disabled sports cause .
in the short 10 years , the cause has achieved success of attention from china and abroad .
it is reasonable to believe that the disabled cause will be increasingly recognized and supported as china 's overall national strength escalates .
the establishment and healthiness of disabled sports organizations provide organizational assurance for the development of the sports cause for handicapped people .
the chinese injured and disabled people sports association ( renamed to the chinese disabled sports association in 1990 ) was established in october , 1983 .
after this a succession of handicapped sports organizations were established throughout china .
in 1985 , the chinese mentally impaired and blind sports associations were also established .
having organization and leadership , activities such as the games and competitions , etc. were increasingly and frequently held . the enthusiasm of handicapped people participating in the sports activities was unprecedentedly increasing , sports levels continually improve and the reserve force is growing .
three national disabled games were held respectively in hefei , tangshan and guangzhou . the scale became larger and larger and the level became higher and higher . the games have received more broad attention and support of the public , and have attracted more disabled people to take part in the events .
since 1984 the chinese disabled sports association has become a member of 8 international disabled sports organizations successively , such as the international para olympic committee , etc. and has established relations with disabled sports organizations in various countries and areas and taken part in international events such as the special olympic games , etc .
in competitions and contacts , disabled chinese people have revealed extraordinary physical abilities , achieved excellent results , enhanced friendship with disabled people from various countries and areas and contributed to the development of physical activities for disabled people around the world .
" the guaranteed law for disabled persons in the people 's republic of china " , which was drafted and implemented in 1991 , stipulates to organize and support disabled people to develop mass sports activities , to hold special games and to participate in important international competitions and communication .
the guarantee of the law has and will continue to boost the vigorous development of the sports cause for china 's disabled .
holding the 6th asia - pacific special olympic games in beijing will motivate all of society to better understand and support disabled sports . it will make the public more conscious of helping disabled people and encourage more disabled people to take part in physical activities . it will , therefore , greatly assist in the development of the sports cause for china 's disabled .
truly , the foundation of disabled sports in china is not very strong , popularization is not yet widespread , and compared with some developed countries , still has a large gap .
however , the " impact " of the far south games foreshadows a bright future for this civilized and progressive cause .
